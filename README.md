# Better Muffling

## Description
Better Muffing adds one block, the Muffling Block. This block muffles sounds nearby. As well as in the minecraft settings,<br>
the sounds are grouped in categories. Each category can be adjusted in the gui to reduce the volume<br>
of the sound category, as well as the range can be adjusted based on the config settings. With the private<br>
mode on, only the placer of the block can adjust the values and can break the block.
